integration of Kafka for real-time data streaming.Integration Complexity:
●
Integration: Integrating multiple technologies such as Elastic Search, Spark,
FastAPI, Kafka, and Hugging Face Transformers seamlessly poses integration
challenges, particularly in ensuring interoperability and eﬃcient communication
between components
Plan to Overcome Challenges:
●
Scalability: Utilize Spark for distributed data processing to handle large-scale
datasets eﬃciently, while optimizing the integration of CLIP for image and text
understanding.
●
Search Accuracy: Implement advanced image processing and similarity
matching algorithms, augmented by CLIP for multi-modal understanding, to
enhance search accuracy and relevance.
●
Real-time Response: Employ Kafka for real-time data streaming to enable timely
processing of image search queries and ensure rapid response times.
●
Integration Complexity: Carefully design and architect the system to streamline
the integration of ElasticSearch, Spark, FastAPI, Kafka, and Hugging Face
Transformers, ensuring smooth operation and minimal overhead.
