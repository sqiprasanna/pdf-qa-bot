Abstract:
This project aims to develop an image search engine leveraging big data technologies,
incorporating advanced models like CLIP for image and text understanding. By
harnessing the power of ElasticSearch, Spark, and FastAPI, in conjunction with Kafka for
real-time data streaming and Hugging Face Transformers for NLP tasks, the system will
provide eﬃcient and accurate image retrieval capabilities. Through the utilization of
advanced algorithms and data processing techniques, the search engine will enable
users to ﬁnd visually similar images within vast repositories, facilitating various
applications in ﬁelds such as e-commerce, content management, and visual data
analysis.
Problem Statement:
Traditional image search engines often struggle to handle large-scale datasets
eﬃciently, leading to slow retrieval times and limited search accuracy. Additionally,
existing solutions may not adequately address the need for similarity-based image
retrieval, hindering the effectiveness of image search applications. Thus, there is a
pressing need for a robust image search engine that can eﬃciently process large
volumes of image data while providing accurate and relevant search results. Integrating
advanced models like CLIP and leveraging Kafka for real-time data streaming, along
with Hugging Face Transformers for NLP tasks, will enhance the system's capabilities in
understanding both image and text data, further improving search accuracy and
relevance.
Current Challenges:
●
Scalability: Managing and processing large-scale image datasets eﬃciently
poses a signiﬁcant challenge, exacerbated by the need to integrate complex
models like CLIP.
●
Search Accuracy: Ensuring accurate retrieval of visually similar images and
relevant textual information requires sophisticated algorithms and techniques.
●
Real-time Response: Providing timely search results, especially in applications
requiring real-time interaction, is crucial but challenging, necessitating the
